# ch.kimhauser.cpp.amicablenumbers
A c++ Version of my hello amicable numbers App coded completely on Android 

## Synopsis
Amicable numbers are two different natural numbers related in such a way that the sum of the proper divisors of each is equal to the other number. That is, s(a)=b and s(b)=a, where s(n)=Ïƒ(n)-n is equal to the sum of positive divisors of n except n itself (see also divisor function).

This app is a sort of **hello world** app I use with every programing language to get started. The current version aims to calculate a user defined range of amicable numbers in the most performant way possible. Check it out and leave your feedback if you like it or have an amendment to state.
